### Building wheels

This directory contains a utility script (`build.sh`) which can be used to 
create completely self-contained manylinux wheels for Python 3.6 - 3.8. The 
build script fetches the latest release of Sqlite and generates the source
amalgamation and header file, which are then compiled into `pysqlite3`. The
resulting Python package can be deployed to any linux environment and will
utilize the latest Sqlite source code with extensions compiled in.

The package name for the wheels is `pysqlite3-binary` to differentiate it from
the standard `pysqlite3` source distribution. The source distribution will link
against the system sqlite by default, though you can provide your own
`sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h` and use `setup.py build_static` to create a
self-contained package as well.

Build artifacts are placed in the `wheelhouse/` directory.
